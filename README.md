# in this task we will work on - Power circuit design and implementation for mobile robot and fixed robot
Used equipments: 
breadbord small
Arduino Uno R3
ultrasonic distance sensor
six servo motor 
Firstly; We connect a wire from Arduino Uno R3 5v to the GND inultrasonic distance sensor 
Secondly; connect a wire from inultrasonic distance sensor 5V to Arduino Uno R3 ( PMW )
Thirdly; connect a wire from inultrasonic distance sensor ( sig ) to Arduino Uno R3 ( PMW )
Fourthly; we put six servo motor 
Fifthly; connect a wire from servo motor Ground to the Arduino Uno R3 ( GND )
Sixthly; connect a wire from servo motor power to the inultrasonic distance sensor ( GND )
Seventh; connect a wire from servo motor signal to Arduino Uno R3 ( PMW )
and we do the same to all six servo motor
